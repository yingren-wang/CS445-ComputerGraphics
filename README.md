# CS445-ComputerGraphics

**Author:**   Yingren Wang

**Course:** 	CS 445 Intro to Computer Graphics

**Semester:**	Fall 2020

**Projects:**	Trigonometric Functions, Simple Game, Simple Drawing Application, Teapot with lighting

**Summary:**

The project is designed for computing graphics using OpenGL. The project contains four separate projects:
1. Draw trigonometric functions using an orthographic projection
    - User can draw cosine or sine function
    - User can use + key to increase, - to decrease the number of vertices used for the rendering
2. Simple game consisting of a sphere that must locate a cube
    - User can use keys to move the sphere to locate the sphere inside of the cube that rendered at a random location before game starts to win the game
3. Simple drawing application
    - User can choose a brush type (sphere, triangle, and cube)
    - User can draw the selected brush type object
    - The object will be drawn in a random color
4. Teapot with lighting
    - The project can render a teapot
    - User can enable/disable diffuse and/or specular lighting from one light source
    - User is able to move the light around within the scene
    - User is able to modify the shininess of the surface
